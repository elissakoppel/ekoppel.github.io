        <p>
Join me as I experience the rollercoaster of emotion that is being a drop of water. My existence is alternately lonely and populated- I voyage through faucets, into clouds, down mountains as rain, down toilet pipelines as human waste. Where will my journey end? All the water on the planet is exactly the same amount as there has been for millions of years. Perhaps, I will be here forever just as I have been here forever. </p>

        <h2>Information about me</h2>
         <ol>
            <ul>
 At a molecular level, I am two hydrogen molecules bonded to two oxygen molecules.</ul>
            <ul> I am odorless and transparent as a vapor and a liquid.</ul>
            <ul> I freeze at 32 degrees Farenheit or 0 degrees Celcius.</ul>
        </ol>
        

        
        <p>Provided here is a video to explain how I move through the world. I could explain it to you, but these scientists are much better at it. </p>

        <p>I have recently found myself in the tundra that is Madison, Wisconsin in the winter time! What is this strange place? An uncomfortable middle ground between natural and manmade, between suburban and urban. One day I was floating as part of an ice sheet on Lake Mendota as the sunset was painting the water shades of pink, blue, and gold. I thought I had finally returned to a natural place, void of human use. Once I vaporized into steam and floated up into the sky, I noticed that the lake was really just a large pond and that I was surrounded by buildings. This is a genuinely strange place. </p>
